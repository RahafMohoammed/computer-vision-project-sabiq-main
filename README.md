### Proactive Road Damage Detection

**Making roads safer… before accidents happen**


##  The Story

Every road tells a story… but not all damage is visible in time.

A small crack today can become a dangerous pothole tomorrow.  
Cities struggle with slow, expensive, and incomplete inspections.

  **What if roads could monitor themselves?**

**SABIQ** AI-powered system that detects cracks and potholes from dashcam/drone video, deduplicates detections.

## Project Objectives

**Problem:** Road surface defects such as potholes and cracks pose a serious risk to vehicle safety and traffic flow. When vehicles are damaged by poorly maintained roads, the responsible municipality is liable for compensation creating both a safety concern and a financial burden. Traditional manual inspections are slow, costly, and cannot cover an entire city effectively.

**Solution:** SABIQ automates road inspection using AI. Upload dashcam/drone video → detect defects → classify severity → store → prioritize repairs.

**Vision 2030 Alignment:**

- Smart Cities: Riyadh ranked 24th globally in IMD Smart Cities Index 2026  
- Quality of Life Program: Better roads = better daily life for millions  
- Year of AI 2026: Practical AI application in municipal services

## Dataset

**Source:** RDD2022  

- 47,420 images from 6 countries, 55,000+ damage annotations  
- Split: Train 26,869 / Val 5,758 / Test 5,758  
- Merged 4 classes → 3: crack, other corruption, pothole  
- Augmented 7,788 pothole images (Albumentations) to fix class imbalance  
- Final training set: 34,657 images  

---

## Methodology

**1. Preprocessing:** Class merging (5→3), data cleaning, offline augmentation for potholes  

**2. Model:** YOLO26m (21.7M params, 74.7 GFLOPs) latest YOLO with C3k2 blocks and C2PSA attention  

**3. Training:** 3 iterative versions on A100 GPU  

**4. Video Deduplication:** ByteTrack (ECCV 2022) assigns unique ID per defect across frames. Same defect in 30 frames → stored once.

## Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|---------|
| Potholes only 10% of data | Albumentations augmentation (+7,788 images) |
| Same defect repeated 30x in video | ByteTrack tracking 1 ID per defect |
| Manual dedup was complex (50 lines) | ByteTrack replaced it (~10 lines) |
